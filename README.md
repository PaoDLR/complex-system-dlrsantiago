Analysis of the System

Your analysis should include:

•	What general behaviors arise in this system?  How does the wealth of the agents change over time? At the aggregate level? At the individual level?

-	The general behaviors that the researchers noticed is that as the population number of agents increase, the average money, highest money, and lowest money of the agents decreases. With this, the aggregate level would mean that the averages would be lower as well as the highest money and lowest money that an agent has; as compared to the individual level where in if you only send in a single digit number of agents, the highest money of an agent with a single digit pool of population is greater than of a double or triple digit pool of agents. Same goes for lowest, and average.

•	How does the diversity of strategies influence the dynamics of the system?

-	The system that the researchers implemented on the agents is random. With this kind of system, the agents do not have any knowledge of which pool benefits them, or which agents are in a certain pool. Having this, the dynamics of the system can be predictable as the population of the agents increases since the numbers are incrementing and the formula will be affected since dividing it per agent will be larger than it originally was. For example, the average money of an agent in a certain pool will certainly decrease if the population is large.

•	Are there generally classes of agent behavior (say, based on what data they use, how they process it, or the agent's overall sophistication) that lead to better performance?

-	Since the researchers implemented the system where in it is randomized, they did not consider about the behavior of the agents due to its randomization.

•	What happens to the system if you violate one of the original assumptions of the problem and allow the agents to alter their strategies over time by observing the performance and strategic details of the other agents?

-	If such a scenario would be implemented on the simulation, then the agent would be more careful in selecting a pool since they are now aware of its costs. Also, if they can observe the performance and know the strategic details of other agents, then the agents would most likely take advantage of it and use the gathered observations in deciding which pool is suitable for them.

•	Suppose that meta-agents exist that can coordinate the behaviors of a subset of the agents (and split the resulting payoffs equally across the subset) how does this impact the system's behavior?

-	Like the answer above; if such a scenario would be implemented on the simulation, then the meta-agent would be more careful in selecting a pool since they are now aware of its costs and have the power to coordinate the behaviors of the agents in a subset.

•	How do the answers to the above questions change as:

o	tau is altered?

o	If tau (tax) is altered, then the results shown in the simulation will change depending on the value set. If the tax is higher, chances are that the average, highest, and lowest money will be lower than normal. Else if tax is lowered, chances are that the average, highest, and lowest money will be higher than normal.

o	you change the total number of agents in the world?

o	Like in tau, if the total number of agents is decreased then chances are that the average, highest, and lowest money will be higher than normal. Else if the total number of agents is increased then chances are that the average, highest, and lowest money will be lower than normal.
